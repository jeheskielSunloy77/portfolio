I used to be the person who tried to bend "Clean Architecture" into every Go project. It rarely helped. After a few over-engineered APIs and some raised eyebrows, I found a simpler, more Go-friendly way to keep things tidy and testable.

The core idea is: prefer clarity over ceremony. Keep packages straightforward, put interfaces where they're actually used, and use small, focused services for business logic. Below is what worked for me in real projects.

## Why classic Clean Architecture feels off in Go

Uncle Bob's patterns shine in languages with heavy DI frameworks and lots of abstractions. Go prefers flatter, simpler code:

- Go likes plain packages and direct wiring; deep layering adds noise.
- Creating interfaces for everything is usually overkill.
- Go's explicit error handling clashes with exception-heavy examples in most Clean Architecture write-ups.
- Adding extra "interface" packages often fragments the codebase rather than improving it.

That said, the principles behind Clean Architectureâ€”separation of concerns, testability, and decouplingâ€”are still valuable. They just need a lighter, Go-centric application.

## A practical project layout that works

Here's a layout I use that keeps things organized without unnecessary complexity:

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.go          # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/              # Your business stuff
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.go
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ errors.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service/             # Business logic lives here
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository/          # Data access
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ postgres/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ memory/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transport/           # HTTP/gRPC/CLI stuff
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ http/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ grpc/
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/                     # Reusable bits
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

The difference: I favor "services" over abstract "use cases" and let Go packages express boundaries naturally.

## Keep the domain small and clear

Domain types should be plain and easy to reason about:

```go
type User struct {
    ID        string    `json:"id"`
    Email     string    `json:"email"`
    Name      string    `json:"name"`
    CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}

func (u *User) Validate() error {
    if u.Email == "" {
        return ErrInvalidEmail
    }
    if u.Name == "" {
        return ErrInvalidName
    }
    return nil
}
```

No magic constructors, no unnecessary patternsâ€”just a clear data shape and straightforward validation.

## Services: where business logic lives

Services coordinate domain logic and repositories. They keep complexity out of handlers:

```go
type UserService struct {
    repo   UserRepository
    logger *slog.Logger
}

func (s *UserService) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, email, name string) (*domain.User, error) {
    user := &domain.User{
        ID:        generateID(),
        Email:     email,
        Name:      name,
        CreatedAt: time.Now(),
    }

    if err := user.Validate(); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    if existing, _ := s.repo.GetByEmail(ctx, email); existing != nil {
        return nil, domain.ErrUserExists
    }

    return user, s.repo.Create(ctx, user)
}
```

Services are easy to test and reason about, and they match Go's straightforward style.

## Repositories: interfaces where they make sense

Define repository interfaces close to their consumersâ€”usually in the same package as the service that uses them:

```go
type UserRepository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *domain.User) error
    GetByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (*domain.User, error)
}
```

Implementations (Postgres, in-memory for tests, etc.) live where they belong.

## Thin transport layer

Keep HTTP or gRPC handlers minimalâ€”just translate requests to service calls and format responses:

```go
type UserHandler struct {
    service *service.UserService
}

func (h *UserHandler) CreateUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req CreateUserRequest
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        writeError(w, "invalid JSON", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    user, err := h.service.CreateUser(r.Context(), req.Email, req.Name)
    if err != nil {
        handleServiceError(w, err)
        return
    }

    writeJSON(w, user, http.StatusCreated)
}
```

Thin handlers make refactoring easier and keep transport concerns separate from business logic.

## Wiring: explicit and simple

I wire dependencies in main with plain functionsâ€”no DI container surprises:

```go
func main() {
    db := setupDatabase()
    logger := setupLogger()

    userRepo := postgres.NewUserRepository(db)
    userService := service.NewUserService(userRepo, logger)
    userHandler := http.NewUserHandler(userService)

    router := setupRoutes(userHandler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```

Explicit wiring is easy to follow and debug.

## Testing is the payoff

One big win from this structure: tests are straightforward. Swap in an in-memory repository and run service tests without mocks:

```go
func TestUserService_CreateUser(t *testing.T) {
    repo := memory.NewUserRepository()
    logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(io.Discard, nil))
    service := service.NewUserService(repo, logger)

    user, err := service.CreateUser(context.Background(), "test@example.com", "John")

    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Equal(t, "test@example.com", user.Email)
}
```

No heavy mocking frameworks, simple setups, reliable tests.

## When this approach fits best

- Medium-sized APIs (5â€“50 endpoints)
- Team projects where clarity matters
- Projects that may need multiple transports (REST, gRPC, CLI)
- Codebases that evolve frequently

## What I avoid

- Over-abstraction and generic repositories
- Moving interfaces into separate "interface" packages
- Deep layering that hides intent

## Final note

Clean Architecture brings good ideas, but in Go the goal is pragmatic clarity. Prefer simple packages, interfaces where theyâ€™re useful, and services that do the orchestration. Your code should be readable and testableâ€”prefer that over purist architectures.
